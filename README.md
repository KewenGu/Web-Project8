This is a website that allows users to post their text/message on it, and show their thoughts to others.

In this assignment, I utilized the express-session api. Each session has a duration of 10 mins. Therefore, if a user closes his/her browser, and the session becomes inactive for more than 10 mins, this session will not be valid any more. If the user visits the webpage later on, a new session will be created and a new session id will be assigned.
